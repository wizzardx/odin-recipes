# Odin Recipes

## Introduction
Odin Recipes is a basic recipe website created as part of the Odin Project curriculum. The Odin Project is a comprehensive program for aspiring web developers, and this project demonstrates foundational HTML skills. The recipes were chosen through a search for various cuisines, providing a diverse selection for the project.

## Project Description
This project involves building a minimalist yet functional recipe website. The primary goal is to display an understanding of basic HTML structure and content organization, focusing on creating a user-friendly and informative site.

## Objective
To practice and enhance HTML coding abilities, particularly in structuring a website and organizing content effectively, without delving into advanced styling or scripting. This includes practicing basic HTML elements like links, lists, paragraphs, and images.

## Technologies Used
