# Odin Recipes

## Project Description
Odin Recipes is a basic recipe website, designed to showcase fundamental HTML skills. This project involves building a website with an index page linking to various recipes.

## Objective
The primary objective is to practice and enhance HTML coding abilities, focusing on structure and content organization without advanced styling.

## Technologies Used
- HTML

## Project Structure
- **Index Page**: The main landing page that provides links to all the recipes.
- **Recipe Pages**: Individual pages for each recipe, accessible from the index page.

## Current Design Philosophy
The design is intentionally minimalist, adhering to a basic or brutalist web design approach. The focus is on HTML structure rather than aesthetics.

## Future Plans
Future updates will include styling with CSS to improve the website's visual appeal and user experience.
